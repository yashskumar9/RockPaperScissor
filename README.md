# Rock, Paper, Scissor(Basic)

Rock, Paper, Scissors is a classic hand game that many of us fondly remember playing as kids. The game involves two players choosing between three options—rock, paper, and scissors—where each choice has a specific advantage over another:

* Rock crushes scissors.
* Scissors cut paper.
* Paper covers rock.

In this project, we recreate this game using Python, where the player competes against the computer.

This beginner-friendly Python project covers essential programming elements such as:

* Taking user input.
* Generating random choices for the computer using Python's random module.
* Using conditional statements (if, elif, and else) to determine the winner.
* Repeating the game using loops for an interactive experience.

To run the code:
```bash
python app.py
```


By developing this game, you’ll gain hands-on experience with Python basics and get a taste of how to build interactive programs. Whether you're stepping into the world of programming or simply revisiting a childhood favorite, this project is both a learning opportunity and a delightful activity. Let's get started!
